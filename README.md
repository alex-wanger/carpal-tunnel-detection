# carpal-tunnel-detection
A project that attempts to create an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) for an embedded system that detects problematic behavior that could lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Implementation
The microcontroller of choice for this project is the Arduino Uno V3, more specifically, the processor on the board, the Atmega328p. This project will be written in avr-c.
